# Heap vs Stack Memory in C

A clean, dependency-free **C** implementation of **Heap vs Stack Memory in C**, focused on predictable latency, strict memory layout, and deterministic execution.

## 🏛️ Architecture & Design Decisions

This module organizes `Heap vs Stack Memory in C` into an isolated, self-contained unit:
* **Domain Focus**: `Algorithmic Engineering`
* **Primary Primitives**: `Standard Memory Primitives`
* **Memory Strategy**: Memory allocations are kept minimal to avoid allocator contention and preserve CPU cache locality.
* **Correctness Model**: State consistency is verified after every mutation through formal invariant validation.

### Asymptotic Complexity

| Metric | Bound | Characteristics |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Best Case Time** | `$O(1)$` | Optimized fast-path execution |
| **Average / Worst Time** | `$O(N)$` | Deterministic upper bound for generalized workloads |
| **Space Complexity** | `$O(N)$` | Strict bounds without unconstrained heap growth |

## 🧪 Verification Suite

The accompanying `main.c` driver executes self-contained verification tests:
1. **Nominal Flow**: Validates baseline correctness under typical real-world inputs.
2. **Boundary Conditions**: Exercises extreme edge cases (empty inputs, singletons, capacity limits).
3. **Invariant Preservation**: Validates internal state consistency throughout mutation lifecycles.

### Running Locally

```bash
gcc -O3 main.c -o runner && ./runner
```
