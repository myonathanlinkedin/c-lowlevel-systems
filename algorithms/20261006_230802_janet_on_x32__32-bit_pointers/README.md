# Janet on x32: 32-bit Pointers, 64-bit Speed, 25% Less RAM in C

An in-memory reference implementation of **Janet on x32: 32-bit Pointers, 64-bit Speed, 25% Less RAM** in **C**, adhering to standard library idioms, clean data structures, and assertion test suites.

## Implementation Details

* **Category**: `Algorithmic Engineering`
* **Data Structure Foundation**: `Standard Memory Primitives`
* **Allocation Pattern**: Zero external heap dependencies; designed as a pure in-memory algorithmic component.
* **Invariant Integrity**: State consistency is verified after mutations through assertion test coverage.

## Performance Characteristics

* **Time**: `O(N)` average, with `O(1)` best-case response under ideal conditions.
* **Space**: `O(N)` memory usage.

## Test Harness

To compile and execute the test assertions for this module:

```bash
gcc -O3 main.c -o runner && ./runner
```
